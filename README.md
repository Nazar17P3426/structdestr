# structdestr.exe-sourcecode
re-releasing the source code of my old C++ malware made on 29.06.2022 with destructive function removed. For educational purposes only.
<br>
This was made for Dev C++'s TDM-GCC compiler, so it won't work in Visual Studio
<br>
If you want to compile this with Visual Studio (with BSOD function disabled), then add this line below #include <cmath>:<br>
#define M_PI 3.14159265358979323846
